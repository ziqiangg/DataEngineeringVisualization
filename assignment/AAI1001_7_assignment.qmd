# Project Proposal
Please ensure that you have installed these packages in your R environment before running the code chunks below.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse) # for data manipulation and visualization
library(metR) # for contour labels
library(viridis) # for color scales
library(ggpp) # for position_dodgenudge 
library(ggrepel) # for text repelling
library(directlabels) # for categorical text labeling
library(ggforce) # for enclosing shapes
```

# Introduction
Using data engineering and visualisation with various packages in R, we will create a poster that accurately and thoughtfully displays the socioeconomic factors that influence fertility/birth rates in Singapore. To do so we will be using data sourced from [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/datasets/d_733c6493145ea436f49e9af17a922a58/view){target="blank"} as well as [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harveytan/singapore-historical-fertility-rate){target="blank"}.

## Analysis of Original Visualisations
The original visualisations from the Straits Times are shown below,

![Total fertility rate from 2019 to 2023](imgs/total_fertility_rate.png)

![Number of births from 2019 to 2023](imgs/num_births.png)
Visualisations adapted from *[Straits Times: Singapore’s total fertility rate hits record low in 2023, falls below 1 for first time](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/singapore-s-total-fertility-rate-hits-record-low-in-2023-falls-below-1-for-first-time){target="_blank"}*

The original visualisations focus on the total fertility rate and the number of births in Singapore from 2019 to 2023. While these visualisations provide a clear overview of the declining fertility trend, they lack depth in exploring the underlying socioeconomic factors that contribute to this trend.

In a more recent article, *[Straits Times: Why the fertility rate doesn’t capture socio-economic or cultural trends](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/why-the-fertility-rate-doesn-t-capture-socio-economic-or-cultural-trends){target="_blank"}*, it critiques the visualizations represented, stating that the first article statistically misrepresented the data to show that single women are having less kids but not accounting for other socioeconomic factors that led to the decline in fertility rate.

## Proposed Improvements

These are the improvements that our group have chosen to propose to improve on the first article by including the following dimensions:

1. **Monthly work hours**: To show the relationship between work hours and fertility rates.

2. **Monthly Income**: To show the relationship between income and fertility rates, as well as the impact of economic factors on family planning decisions.

3. **Gender**

4. **Fertility Rate by Year & Age**: To show the fertility rate by age group and year, highlighting trends in fertility across different age demographics.

Overall, we aim to present a more balanced viewpoint that shows the economical and employment burdens of Singaporeans by gender.


# Data Engineering
Using the 'tidyverse' package, we will perform data engineering to clean and prepare the data for visualisation. This includes:

- someone write

- someone write

## Data Loading

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
employment_details <- read_csv("datasets/ResidentWorkingPersonsAged15YearsandOverbyMonthlyIncomefromWorkNumberofHoursWorkedandSexCensusofPopulation2000.csv")

fertility_by_age <- read_csv("datasets/total_fertility_rate_by_age.csv")
fertility_by_race <- read_csv("datasets/total_fertility_rate_by_race.csv")
```

## Cleaning

Find outliers and remove anomalies.
