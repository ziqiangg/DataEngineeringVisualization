# Project Proposal
Please ensure that you have installed these packages in your R environment before running the code chunks below.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse) # for data manipulation and visualization
library(metR) # for contour labels
library(viridis) # for color scales
library(ggpp) # for position_dodgenudge 
library(ggrepel) # for text repelling
library(directlabels) # for categorical text labeling
library(ggforce) # for enclosing shapes
```

# Introduction
Using data engineering and visualisation with various packages in R, we will create a poster that accurately and thoughtfully displays the socioeconomic factors that influence fertility/birth rates in Singapore. To do so we will be using data sourced from [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/datasets/d_733c6493145ea436f49e9af17a922a58/view){target="blank"} as well as [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harveytan/singapore-historical-fertility-rate){target="blank"}.

## Analysis of Original Visualisations
The original visualisations from the Straits Times are shown below,

![Total fertility rate from 2019 to 2023](imgs/total_fertility_rate.png)

![Number of births from 2019 to 2023](imgs/num_births.png)
Visualisations adapted from *[Straits Times: Singaporeâ€™s total fertility rate hits record low in 2023, falls below 1 for first time](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/singapore-s-total-fertility-rate-hits-record-low-in-2023-falls-below-1-for-first-time){target="_blank"}*

# Data Engineering
Using the 'tidyverse' package, we will perform data engineering to clean and prepare the data for visualisation. This includes:

- someone write

- somone write

## Data Loading

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
employment_details <- read_csv("datasets/ResidentWorkingPersonsAged15YearsandOverbyMonthlyIncomefromWorkNumberofHoursWorkedandSexCensusofPopulation2000.csv")

fertility_by_age <- read_csv("datasets/total_fertility_rate_by_age.csv")
fertility_by_race <- read_csv("datasets/total_fertility_rate_by_race.csv")
```
